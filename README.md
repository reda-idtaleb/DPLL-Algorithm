# DPLL Algorithm for solving the CNF-SAT problem.

This project implements the DPLL algorithm for solving CNF-SAT formulas. The implemented DPLL algorithm is optimized, it uses parallelism in order to reduce the calculation time led by recursion on complex CNF formulas.

**Note: You can read the manual.pdf to better understand how the project works. The manual is in French.**
